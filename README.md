# [My Portfolio](https://fanglada.github.io/myportfolio/)
## Project analysis
### User profile:
The final user of this portfolio website will be recruiters, or clients who seek to evaluate my  skills, experience of developer and programmer. These users are typically professionals in the tech or creative fields who want to quickly and efficiently my technical capabilities, past projects and work experience.

### Information architecture: 
The one-page website is organized into distinct sections, ensuring that information is both accessible and easy to navigate. The layout begins with a **hero section** that immediately introduces my name and role, giving a quick, impactful first impression. This section includes a brief tagline or statement that reflects my professional identity and goals. A prominent **contact button** will be easily visible in this area, encouraging users to reach out without needing to scroll further if they are already interested.

Directly below, an **About Me** section provides a concise but meaningful description of my background, professional values, and motivations in the tech industry. Following this, a **Training and Experience** section will feature both formal education and relevant courses, certifications, or workshops. This section also highlights my professional journey with a clear overview of past roles, responsibilities, and companies, allowing potential employers to quickly gauge my experience.

The **Skills** section comes next, listing specific programming languages, software tools, and frameworks with which I am proficient. To give a practical sense of my expertise, each skill will be categorized based on proficiency level or relevance to the types of projects I typically work on, helping visitors understand how I might fit into their team or project.

The **Projects** section then showcases some of my best and most relevant work. Each project is accompanied by a short description of its purpose, the role I played, and the key technologies I used. Where possible, each project will include a link to view a live demo, repository, or case study, offering visitors a deeper look into my practical skills and achievements.

Finally, the **Contact** section will provide links to my professional social media profiles, such as LinkedIn and GitHub, as well as an email option, allowing interested parties a straightforward way to connect. This carefully structured layout ensures that users can easily access relevant information about my skills and experiences, building a complete and engaging picture of my professional profile.

### Visual design: 
The visual design of this portfolio website uses a dark, gradient background that gives it a modern and professional feel, creating a contrast that allows text and elements to stand out. The logo, with the bold orange initials "FA", adds a personal branding touch and the colour is systematically used in other key areas (such as the headers and the contact button) to create a cohesive and balanced colour scheme. This choice of orange as an accent color conveys energy and confidence, which works well for a developer’s portfolio.

The font is **Onest** with large, bold text for name and role ("Ferran Anglada, Developer & Programmer") that immediately catches the eye. The role title is distinguished by a contrasting white font for "Developer and programmer", adding emphasis. Using different weights and colors in the headers and body of text creates a clear hierarchy, improving readability and making it easier for visitors to navigate the page.

The design follows a simple one-page structure with navigation links at the top, allowing easy access to different sections. Key sections such as "About", "Education", "Experience", "Skills" and "Projects" are organized in a vertical scrolling format. The **Contact Me** button is outlined in orange and located in the center of the hero section, attracting attention without overwhelming the design. This button style also adds a sense of interactivity, inviting visitors to take action.

Overall, this visual design balances professional appeal with a touch of personality, making it an effective presentation for a developer’s online presence.

#### CSS framework (Tailwind CSS)
I used Tailwind CSS to create my portfolio because it offers flexibility and speeds up development. Tailwind allows me to build a fully customized design using utility classes, making it easy to adjust styles directly in the HTML without needing extensive custom CSS. Plus, with its extensive documentation and community support, it’s accessible and easy to use, making it a great choice for my project.
